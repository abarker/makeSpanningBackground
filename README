I started this project as an exercise in using numpy's ndimages.  The program
selects and sets the background wallpaper on multiple displays/monitors (and
single monitors as well).  It runs on both Linux and Windows.  (Most of the
testing has been on one and two monitor systems with Python 2.7 or 3.2, on
Ubuntu and Windows 7.)  Note that under KDE and Xfce on Linux the generated
image will not be automatically set to be the wallpaper, in "spanned" mode;
you'll have to apply those settings by hand.

The dependencies are as follows:

   Linux with Python 2.x (at least Python 2.6):
                   Ubuntu                               Fedora
      numpy       sudo apt-get install python-numpy    yum install numpy
      scipy       sudo apt-get install python-scipy    yum install scipy
      PIL         sudo apt-get install python-imaging  yum install python-imaging
      xrandr      pre-installed for most distributions 
      gsettings   pre-installed for most distributions

   Linux with Python 3.x:
      Same as for Python 2.x.  For numpy and scipy just apt-get the version
      that starts with python3, e.g., python3-numpy.  The PIL library
      has not yet been officially ported (as of Nov, 2012), so you would 
      need to get one of the unofficial 3.x versions of PIL working.
      One version of the ported source code (needs compilation) is at 
      http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pil
      http://mail.python.org/pipermail/image-sig/2011-August/006843.html

   Windows with Python 2.x or 3.x (at least Python 2.6):
      Needs numpy, scipy, and PIL.  Windows users who want binaries and are not
      using a package like Python(x,y) where the dependencies are pre-installed
      might try the following (get the version to match the installed Python):

      http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy
      http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy
      http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pil

      Note that on Windows the background mode must be explicitly set to 
      "tiled" in the standard wallpaper-selection dialog window.  Also,
      on XP you may need to always choose the .bmp format for the saved
      image files.

   Windows Cygwin Python
      The dependencies are the same as in Windows.  Cygwin comes with 
      packages for python-argparse, python-imaging, and python-numpy.
      Unfortunately, scipy is apparently difficult to install in Cygwin.

Run makeSpanningBackground --help for the documentation.  The output of
that command follows.
